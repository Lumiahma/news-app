# news-app
A small single-page news application, built as an experiment with Meteor.js and React.js

TODO: Update internals to Meteor 1.3, remove unneeded dependencies plus a million other things

INSTALLATION:

1) Install Meteor.js on your system (https://www.meteor.com/install)
2) Clone this repository

To run the software, go into the repository directory and type meteor (ie. C:\news-app\meteor if you cloned the repo into C:\news-app - the app will take a while to start up on the first time due to downloading & installing a bunch of crap)
